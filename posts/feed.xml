      <description>The software culture I operate in is strongly influenced by Extreme Programming (XP) and a big part of this is the importance of test driven development (TDD). We typically don&amp;rsquo;t approve PRs without unit tests, as a concrete example. This post will discuss using TDD to design and implement a feature in a top-down fashion. The examples are in C# and ASP.NET, but I expect them to be understandable for people using different languages and frameworks.</description>

      <title>Scala 3: Returning implicit function literals</title>

      <description>When I recently looked at implicit functions in Scala 3 (still only available as a pre-release compiler codenamed &amp;lsquo;Dotty&amp;rsquo;) I wondered: What if we need to perform an expensive operation before returning an implicit function literal?
This turned out to be a lot harder to achieve than I anticipated. Lets first look at how this can be done via an ordinary lambda function, though, before going any further.
(You can try this out in the dotty REPL, dotr)</description>

      <description>One of the many new things in Scala 3 (still only available as a pre-release compiler codenamed &amp;lsquo;Dotty&amp;rsquo;) is the ability to define implicit functions - lambda functions with only implicit parameters.
A few neat things are enabled by using implicit functions as parameters or return values, and I wanted to explore this further.
TL;DR: implicit parameters in Scala 2 are eager to bind to their implicit values, whereas implicit functions as parameters or return values in Scala 3, allows us to bind implicit values lazily.</description>
